###### Ha-ha annoying funni png image<br>
Seriously, it is mod, that adds png image, that follows you and does a lot of damage on contact.

## Instructions

* ### Getting project

You can get project via Github's web-page, or using CLI of your choice.<br>
Also you can get it from releases tab, with compiled binaries.

* ### Building project

Project can be built using standalone [.NET Core 6 package](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
or tModLoader's built-in .NET redistributable.

On this step it is preferred to use IDE like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/),
[Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or any other IDE of your choice.

[tModLoader's developer guide](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/tModLoader-guide-for-developers)
is good starting point, if you are new to Terraria modding.

* ### Making changes
If you planning to do your own Nextbot, don't forget to rename ***everything***, to avoid compatibility issues

And if you want to contribute to this project, glance upon my existing code, and try to follow it's conventions.
Any help appreciated.
